\section{Changes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Added the checklist manager which was not a part of the original
    objectives
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Helped more to visualize the project
    \item Aided in gathering statistics for how well the checklist performed
    \item Using Kotlin helped speed up development, it simplifies parts
      of Java and omitted a lot of boilerplate code that is required in Java,
      such as setters and getters
  \end{itemize}
  \item How the Formal Model would interact was modified
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initially was designed so that the formal model would complete
      the entirety of the checklist, however, it was not useful for interacting
      with the flight simulator
    \item Modified the model to provide it would be similar to actions pilots can
      do in the cockpit
    \item Therefore acts like Read Checklist → Pilot Action (VDM) → Do action (XPC)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Originally was supposed to write an original plugin to connect to the flight simulator
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Whilst creating the plugin, sockets were confusing and accidentally stumbled
      on the X-Plane Connect GitHub repository
    \item This could have been prevented if a design document was created and
      time was spent researching for tools in obscure places
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
