% What changes were made?
\section{Changes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Added the checklist manager which was not a part of the original
    objectives
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Helped more to visualize the project
    \item Aided in gathering statistics for how well the checklist performed
    \item Using Kotlin helped speed up development, it simplifies parts
      of Java and omitted a lot of boilerplate code that is required in Java,
      such as setters and getters
  \end{itemize}
  \item How the Formal Model would interact was modified
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initially was designed so that the formal model would complete
      the entirety of the checklist, however, it was not useful for interacting
      with the flight simulator
    \item Modified the model to provide it would be similar to actions pilots can
      do in the cockpit
    \item Therefore acts like Read Checklist → Pilot Logic (VDM) → Do Action (XPC)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Originally was supposed to write an original plugin to connect to the flight simulator
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Whilst creating the plugin, sockets were confusing and accidentally stumbled
      on the X-Plane Connect GitHub repository
    \item This could have been prevented if a design document was created and
      time was spent researching for tools in obscure places
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% What objectives were met?
\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most of the objectives were met
  \item One of the original objectives was to research pilot
    reaction times and how long it takes pilots to complete an action
  \begin{itemize}
    \item However, not able to do that as there are too many factors
      that can affect a pilot's reaction time, such as age,
      experience on an aircraft, total experience, how far a button is
      from the pilot, etc.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Objective 2.a. was met to an extent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There could be more variables that could be monitored. Such
      as engine fire, could monitor the engine temperature or thrust
      produced by engine
    \item This would have required a substantial amount of planning
      as checklists does have a bit of logic like if statements,
      for example \enquote{If APU is available, then do \ldots else do \ldots}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Objective 2.b was also met to an extent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item However, it is manual at this stage due to limitations of XPC
      and setting up the aircraft
    \item The test data is stored on the database, hence test results
      can be analysed to see the consistency between each test
  \end{itemize}
  \item The Checklist Tester does not currently run actions from the
    Formal Model due to implementing the functions from VDMJ being
    laborious
  \item Hence focus was put on XPC first, as it would produce direct results
\end{itemize}
