\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item US Airways Flight 1549 had two interesting points in the investigation
        \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Checklist in the QRH for ditching was in a poor order,
                i.e. ditch button was one of the last options
            \item NTSB tried to use simulators, where they tested
                the simulator with immediate reactions - which were
                deemed us unrealistic
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Reasons for project
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Order is important, especially for time sensitive
                situations
            \item Seeing what the action of forgetting a step could
                result in - Checklist Manifesto intro
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    & \textbf{Description:} An investigation on an aircraft that
        suffered from a dual engine failure from a bird strike
        forcing the pilots to land on the Hudson River. \\
    & \textbf{Reason:} The investigation found that the QRH was too
        lengthy and the pilots' used their experience to prioritize
        essential actions outside the QRH to keep the aircraft in control. \\
